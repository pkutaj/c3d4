### 1. BIRME: The Essential Qualities
* [The Qualities of Planning](..\productivity\2021-03-18-The-Qualities-of-Planning.md)
* I dedicate 2x 15-minute rounds with Toggl and block this ~40 minutes daily to the
    - task configuration
    - task control

### 2. Capture
* time: throughout-the-day
* tool #1: **Google tasks on Blackberry KEY2** and dedicated Captures bucket on the home screensync
    ![](../assets/img003051.png)
* tool #2: [Full Screen for Google Tasks][#2]
* tool #3: **Gmail** 
* all tasks are captured immediatelly as per GTD
* thorough the day you have the bucket nearby and you captures todos and don't jump into execution
* categorization starts already here by prefixing the task with the category (dimension) shortcut
    - prefixes are organized alphabetically to remember them, to know by heart
    - my list is A-I: #ALX, #BB, #CAR, #DD, #EXP, #FF, #GRL, #HRM, #CHR, #I
    - a smartphone allows to have a shortcut for each of them (type *ee* → `#EXP` + type a capture_item)

### 3. 2D Configure 
* time: 15-minutes-morning-ritual
* aim: 3x0: past0 + inbox0 + capture0
* tool #1: **Google Calendar**
* tool #2: **Gmail**
* tool #3: [Full Screen for Google Tasks][#2]
* open Calendar and release/cross/move _leftovers_ from yesterday/previous day
* open Inbox and for emails
    - _either_ release (delete/unsubscribe)
    - _or_ convert into tasks → snooze to make it disappear from the inbox
* most of the day should already be _explicitly_ present in your calendar as a series *const_blocks*
* reserved blocks correspond with the selected _identity_ 
* step #1: triage them all
    - release/remove as many insignificant captures as possible (KonMari)
    - assign date/prio and move them to _categories_
    - keep quickies for 1D
* **DO** *quickies* (< 120 seconds) NOW; the overhead is more expensive - aka "2 minute rule" (GTD)
* for those to keep, assign
    - rank (priority)
    - cell (category)
    - deadline (date)
    - _no execution, no consumption_

### 4. 3D Control
* tool#1: [Desktop app for Google Tasks][#1]
    - choose rediculous custom backgrounds and work at commiting them to memory (think of it in-day)
    - I am giving them **alphabetical names** to keep them in my head (A-I)
* tool#2: **Google Calendar**
* time: 30 minutes
* aim: the day is _planned == planted_

1. go through categories in alphabetical order
2. select ones for **today**
3. either *do* or *defer* or *delegate*
4. assign a time to the deferred ones

#### 4.1. Google Calendar
* use week view to see the progress of the week
* there is a feeling of teritorial conquest with this view, leaving no open tasks behind
* have week plan

### 5. Done
* Done for the day
* [Drastically Reduce Stress with a Work Shutdown Ritual - Study Hacks - Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/08/drastically-reduce-stress-with-a-work-shutdown-ritual/)
* Go through everything
