### 1. B-locked
> The general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.
— Sun Tzu

> Plans are useless, planning is essential
— Churchill

* This is the morning ritual that is time-blocked in a calendar
* Cal Newport's idea of time blocking
* Also Churchill's _Plans are useless, planning is essential_
    - the plan is not the thing

### 2. I-nShape
* Always up-to-date
* Nothing rotting
* Scrum call this Increment
* Ron Jeffrey's and agile's idea that it is shippable all the time
* Here, this means that there is nothing outstanding, rotting, forgotten, it's _in shape_

### 3. R-eflective
* Seth's Godin idea of system improvements

>Improving a system returns our effort many times over.

>Fix your supply chain. Dig deep into your communication rhythms. Figure out the priority list. Quit the tasks that are holding you back. Walk away from dead ends. ADD RIGOR TO YOUR PROCESSES. Understand the difference between the things that feel urgent and those that are truly important.

>None of this works if you do it temporarily. The point is to create and fix systems with finality. Identify a class of projects that your team will do instead of you and then never do them again. Reorganize your data archiving approach and then stick with it. Build a system for lifelong learning and then maintain the commitment.

>In any given moment, an urgency that feels like an emergency gives us the permission to abandon our systems and simply dive in and fix it, as only we can. And this permission is precisely why we get stuck, precisely why the next urgency is likely to appear tomorrow.

>Resolutions don’t work. Habits and systems can.
